2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTLP-1#1 Critical Warning
Combinatorial Loop Alert  
1 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is PWM/refresh0_n_0. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: PWM/refresh0.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net PWM/flag_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PWM/flag_reg_i_1/O, cell PWM/flag_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net PWM/refresh0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin PWM/refresh0/O, cell PWM/refresh0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net flowclock_generater/counter_reg[23]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin flowclock_generater/input_decoder38[2]_i_2/O, cell flowclock_generater/input_decoder38[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT PWM/refresh0 is driving clock pin of 9 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
PWM/CompareSignal/flag_reg, PWM/CompareSignal/levels_compare_temp_reg[2],
PWM/CompareSignal/levels_compare_temp_reg[3],
PWM/CompareSignal/levels_compare_temp_reg[4],
PWM/CompareSignal/levels_compare_temp_reg[5],
PWM/CompareSignal/levels_compare_temp_reg[6],
PWM/CompareSignal/levels_compare_temp_reg[7],
PWM/CompareSignal/levels_compare_temp_reg[8]
PWM/CompareSignal/levels_compare_temp_reg[9]
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT flowclock_generater/input_decoder38[2]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
input_decoder38_reg[0], input_decoder38_reg[1], input_decoder38_reg[2]
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
