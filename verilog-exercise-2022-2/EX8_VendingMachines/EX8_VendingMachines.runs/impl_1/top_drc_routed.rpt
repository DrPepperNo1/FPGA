2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Judge/KeyInput_1/clean_n__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Judge/KeyInput_1/clean_n_reg_i_1/O, cell Judge/KeyInput_1/clean_n_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Judge/KeyInput_2/clean_n__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Judge/KeyInput_2/clean_n_reg_i_1__0/O, cell Judge/KeyInput_2/clean_n_reg_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Result/next_state is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Result/FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell Result/FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
